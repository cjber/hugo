This essay presents the results of a python based machine learning exercise in which car prices scraped from Ebay listings are explored. The dataset is freely available from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database), under the [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) licence. It should be noted that significant amount of pre-cleaning was performed on this data to present it in a usable state for this assessment. For readability this pre-cleaning is included as an Appendix.
